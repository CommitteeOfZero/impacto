All third-party code mentioned above is mandatory, included in the build process and compiled into the output executable for impacto on every supported platform and build configuration.

**Additionally, impacto depends on the following external libraries:**

* Platform implementations of C runtime, C++ STL, OpenAL and OpenGL (ES)
* [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm/)
* [LibAtrac9](https://github.com/Thealexbarney/LibAtrac9)
* [Ogg](https://github.com/xiph/ogg)
* [SDL2](https://libsdl.org/download-2.0.php)
* [Vorbis](https://github.com/xiph/vorbis)
* [zlib](https://github.com/madler/zlib)

**Sourcing and linkage:**

* Refer to individual toolchain/platform documentation for standard library licenses and default external library sourcing behaviour.
* Emscripten and NX builds use static linking for all other external libraries, other platforms use dynamic linking.
* glm (being a header-only template library) is always compiled into the output executable.
* The example Emscripten build process explicitly uses emscripten-ports packages for [Ogg](https://github.com/emscripten-ports/Ogg), [SDL2](https://github.com/emscripten-ports/SDL2), [Vorbis](https://github.com/emscripten-ports/Vorbis) and [zlib](https://github.com/emscripten-ports/zlib) and the original authors' source distributions for glm and LibAtrac9.
* The example Win32/MSVC build process explicitly uses vcpkg packages for [OpenAL Soft](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/tree/master/ports/openal-soft), [glm](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/tree/master/ports/glm), [Ogg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/tree/master/ports/libogg), [SDL2](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/tree/master/ports/sdl2), [Vorbis](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/tree/master/ports/libvorbis), [zlib](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/tree/master/ports/zlib) and [FFmpeg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/tree/master/ports/ffmpeg) and the original authors' source distributions for LibAtrac9.
* The example Ubuntu build process explicitly uses build host apt packages for `libopenal-dev` (OpenAL Soft on Ubuntu 18.04), `libogg-dev`, `libsdl2-dev`, `libvorbis-dev`, `zlib1g-dev`, `libavdevice-dev`, `libavfilter-dev`, `libavformat-dev`, `libavcodec-dev`, `libswscale-dev`, `libswresample-dev`, `libavresample-dev` and `libavutil-dev` and the original authors' source distributions for glm and LibAtrac9.
* Win32 install targets copy all required DLLs except the standard C/C++ runtime libraries to the output folder.

** Binary licensing:**

* Unless specified otherwise, impacto source and binaries are covered by [the ISC license](LICENSE) but contain and use the dependencies listed above, requiring third-party copyright notices.
* NX builds statically link OpenAL Soft (assuming this is used as the OpenAL implementation), placing NX binaries under LGPLv2 or later.
* Win32 builds ship OpenAL Soft and FFmpeg as DLLs, thus including LGPLv2 code in the distribution but not inside the impacto executable.

License statements for third-party code in this repository (where given) and external libraries bundled by the build process in at least one supported configuration follow:

>          "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
>          form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
>          editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
>          represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes

>          the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
>
>          "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
>          the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

>          with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
>          institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
>          cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
>          or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
>          or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
>          granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate

>          You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and

>     scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
>     of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
>     works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
>     and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
>     These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
>     culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
>     works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
>     part through the use and efforts of others.
>
>     For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
>     expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
>     associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
>     is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
>     elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
>     terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
>     Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
>
>     1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
>     protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
>     Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
>     limited to, the following:
>
>       i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
>          communicate, and translate a Work;
>      ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
>     iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
>          likeness depicted in a Work;
>      iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
>          subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
>       v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
>          in a Work;
>      vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
>          European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
>          protection of databases, and under any national implementation
>          thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
>          directive); and
>     vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
>          world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
>          implementations thereof.
>
>     2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
>     of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
>     irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
>     Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
>     of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
>     future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
>     worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
>     treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
>     medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
>     including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
>     purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
>     member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
>     successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
>     revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
>     equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
>     as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
>
>     3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
>     be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
>     Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
>     account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
>     extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
>     person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
>     irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
>     Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
>     maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
>     time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
>     of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
>     limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
>     "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
>     applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
>     reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
>     partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
>     of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
>     will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
>     Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
>     action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
>     express Statement of Purpose.
>
>     4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
>
>      a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
>         surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
>      b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
>         warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
>         statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
>         title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
>         infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
>         the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
>         the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
>      c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
>         that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
>         limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
>         Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
>         consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
>         Work.
>      d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
>         party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to

>
>       The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
>     freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
>     Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
>     free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
>
>       This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some
>     specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any
>     other libraries whose authors decide to use it.  You can use it for
>     your libraries, too.
>
>       When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
>     price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
>     have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
>     this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
>     if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
>     in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
>
>       To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
>     anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
>     These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
>     you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it.
>
>       For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
>     or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
>     you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
>     code.  If you link a program with the library, you must provide
>     complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them
>     with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling
>     it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
>
>       Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright
>     the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal
>     permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
>
>       Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain
>     that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
>     library.  If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we
>     want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original
>     version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on
>     the original authors' reputations.
>
>       Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
>     patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free
>     software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect
>     transforming the program into proprietary software.  To prevent this,
>     we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's
>     free use or not licensed at all.
>
>       Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
>     GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs.  This
>     license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain
>     designated libraries.  This license is quite different from the ordinary
>     one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is
>     the same as in the ordinary license.
>
>       The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that
>     they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a
>     program and simply using it.  Linking a program with a library, without
>     changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is
>     analogous to running a utility program or application program.  However, in
>     a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a
>     derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License
>     treats it as such.
>
>       Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General
>     Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software
>     sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries.  We
>     concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better.
>
>       However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the
>     users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the
>     libraries themselves.  This Library General Public License is intended to
>     permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while
>     preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free
>     libraries that are incorporated in them.  (We have not seen how to achieve
>     this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards
>     changes in the actual functions of the Library.)  The hope is that this
>     will lead to faster development of free libraries.
>
>       The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
>     modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
>     "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
>     former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only
>     works together with the library.
>
>       Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary
>     General Public License rather than by this special one.
>
>                       GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
>        TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
>
>       0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which
>     contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized
>     party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library
>     General Public License (also called "this License").  Each licensee is
>     addressed as "you".
>
>       A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
>     prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
>     (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
>
>       The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
>     which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
>     Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
>     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
>     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
>     straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
>     included without limitation in the term "modification".)
>
>       "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
>     making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
>     all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
>     interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
>     and installation of the library.
>
>       Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
>     covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
>     running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
>     such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
>     on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
>     writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
>     and what the program that uses the Library does.
>
>       1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
>     complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
>     you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
>     appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
>     all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
>     warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
>     Library.
>
>       You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
>     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
>     fee.
>
>       2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
>     of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
>     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
>     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
>
>         a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
>
>         b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
>         stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
>
>         c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
>         charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
>
>         d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
>         table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
>         the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
>         is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
>         in the event an application does not supply such function or
>         table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
>         its purpose remains meaningful.
>
>         (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
>         a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
>         application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
>         application-supplied function or table used by this function must
>         be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
>         root function must still compute square roots.)
>
>     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
>     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
>     and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
>     themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
>     sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
>     distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
>     on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
>     this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
>     entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
>     it.
>
>     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
>     your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
>     exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
>     collective works based on the Library.
>
>     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
>     with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
>     a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
>     the scope of this License.
>
>       3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
>     License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
>     this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
>     that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
>     instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
>     ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
>     that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
>     these notices.
>
>       Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
>     that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
>     subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
>
>       This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
>     the Library into a program that is not a library.
>
>       4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
>     derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
>     under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
>     it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
>     must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
>     medium customarily used for software interchange.
>
>       If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
>     from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
>     source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
>     distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
>     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
>
>       5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
>     Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
>     linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
>     work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
>     therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
>
>       However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
>     creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
>     contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
>     library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
>     Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
>
>       When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
>     that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
>     derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
>     Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
>     linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
>     threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
>
>       If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
>     structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
>     functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
>     file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
>     work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
>     Library will still fall under Section 6.)
>
>       Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
>     distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
>     Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
>     whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
>
>       6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or
>     link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
>     work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
>     under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
>     modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
>     engineering for debugging such modifications.
>
>       You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
>     Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
>     this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
>     during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
>     copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
>     directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
>     of these things:
>
>         a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
>         machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
>         changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
>         Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
>         with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
>         uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
>         user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
>         executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
>         that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
>         Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
>         to use the modified definitions.)
>
>         b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
>         least three years, to give the same user the materials
>         specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
>         than the cost of performing this distribution.
>
>         c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
>         from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
>         specified materials from the same place.
>
>         d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
>         materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
>
>       For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
>     Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
>     reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
>     the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally
>     distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
>     components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
>     which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
>     the executable.
>
>       It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
>     restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
>     accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
>     use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
>     distribute.
>
>       7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
>     Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
>     facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
>     library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
>     the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
>     permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
>
>         a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
>         based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
>         facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
>         Sections above.
>
>         b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
>         that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
>         where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
>
>       8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
>     the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
>     attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
>     distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
>     rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
>     or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
>     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
>
>       9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not

>
>       If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
>     possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
>     everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
>     redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
>     ordinary General Public License).
>
>       To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
>     safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
>     convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
>     "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

>         <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
